Then I visited Dr. Jayini for his opinion and he checked my uncle and said he don't require a surgery and started him on partial weight bearing for two more weeks followed by now my in law is advised to start with out Walker and he is able to walk normally.

He recommends surgery only as a last resort. Focus is more on self-healing and food diet including supplements to augment bone weaknesses. Certainly recommended.

I think he is one of the best ortho doctor, I have ever visited. I would advise everyone for joint replacement surgery.</p>
